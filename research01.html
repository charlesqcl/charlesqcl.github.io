                <h3>Highlights</h3>
                <blockquote><p><i>In the context of global warming and extreme heat phenomenon, this study provides a tool for future professionals 
                in designing sustainable city forms. </i></p></blockquote>

                <h3>Background</h3>

                <p>Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important indicator of urban heat environments and can be 
                    largely influenced by the morphology factors of cities. However, previous studies mainly focus on 
                    large-scale and coarse-grained forecast modeling, making it hard to inform architects and urban 
                    designers without the advantage of quick, fine-grained prediction and visualization.
                </p>

                <h3>Methodology</h3>

                <p>The paper uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to address this gap by proposing 
                    a prediction model of city plans (Fig.1 - A) and corresponding LST heat maps (Fig.1 - B). The research framework is as Fig.2.
                </p>

                <h3>Data</h3>

                <p>Taking New York City as an example, we use the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data,
                     Landsat Surface Temperature data, and other relevant data to construct the built environmental dataset (Fig.3) 
                     and the LST dataset (Fig.4).

                <h3>GAN Training</h3>

                <p>The GAN architecture is as Fig.5. We use the data to build seven hundred image pairs as training/test sets (Fig.6) to train/test the model of 
                    predicting LST distribution. As the training continues, it can be obersved that the accuracy of our model gradually increases (Fig.7).

                <h3>Accuracy Analysis</h3>

                <p>We utilize both qualitative and quantitative methods to test our models. For qualitative methods (Fig.8), we visually compare the prediction results
                    of both training and test sets. For quantitative measures (Fig.9-10), we use five metrics to evaluate each model and find epoch 140 performs the best.
                    Eventually, we select epoch 140 as our final model which can generate LST maps relatively quickly and accurately with the input of city plans.

                <h3>AI-aided city design</h3>

                <p>After model selection, different scenarios are simulated to test the application of the model in predicting the environmental impacts 
                    of plan modifications on land surface temperature. Scenarios include green space, building massing, road infrastructure and complex scenario.

                <p><b>Q2:</b> With fixed location/layout and specific design composition, what is a suitable growth rate of urban greening in light of LST? (Fig.11- b & e)<br>
                    <b>A2:</b> For these two samples, a growth rate of 1% is suitable for urban greening that may help reduce LST.
                </p>

                <p><b>Q3:</b> With fixed location/layout and growth rate of greening, how to optimize the design composition to achieve a better LST performance? (Fig.11- c & f)<br>
                    <b>A3:</b> For these two samples, setting grassland:tree canopy=2:8 can aid in lowering LST levels.
                </p>

                <h3>Building Massing scenarios</h3>
                <p><b>Q1:</b> In consideration of LST levels, how to optimize the planar arrangement of building blocks with a fixed coverage ratio and height limit? (Fig.12- a & d)<br>
                    <b>A1:</b> For these two samples, a chessboard-like or mixed block form might be effective in minimizing LST impacts.
                </p>

                <p><b>Q2:</b> With a settled height limit and planar form, what is a suitable building coverage ratio to reduce the impacts of the future intervention on LST? (Fig.12- b & e)<br>
                    <b>A2:</b> For these two samples, a BCR of 0.6 can help minimize the influences on LST.
                </p>

                <p><b>Q3:</b> How to set the optimal height control of different buildings for a better LST performance with specified coverage and planar form? (Fig.12- c & f; Fig.13- a & d)<br>

                <h3>Road Infrastructure scenarios</h3>
                <p><b>Q1:</b> Considering the impacts on LST, how to increase/reduce road width while maintaining the original grid density? (Fig.13- b & e)<br>

                <h3>A complex scenario</h3>

                <p>
                    It can be observed from Fig.14 that through adding scattered or centralized green spaces, changing 
                    compact blocks to loosely arranged ones with courtyards, raising the height of certain building 
                    groups, and reducing road width/density of certain areas, partial LST levels can decrease significantly 
                    by around 3.7% to 6.6% while the overall LST level may drop by about 2.5%.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>
                    In the context of global warming and extreme heat phenomenon, this study provides a tool for future professionals 
                    in designing sustainable city forms. Through our experiment, we have constructed and testified a GAN model connecting 
                    built environment features to the summer daytime land surface temperature in short periods.
                </p>

                <blockquote><p>The cooling effect on LST can be brought by scattered or concentrated urban green spaces, loosely-arranged building 
                forms, less building coverage ratio, and fewer road surface exposures. </p></blockquote>


                <h3>Limitations & Future Works</h3>

                <p>
                    1. The main aim of this study is not to summarize universal guidance on designing the environment to lower LST but to present
                     an AI-based, interactive methodology in LST prediction and design optimization. Therefore, the LST reduction methods concluded 
                     from scenario simulation cannot be generalized at this time.<br><br>
                     
                    2. Various non-design factors such as solar radiation, cloud cover, wind, and humidity can influence LST from the perspective of 
                    climate science. Considering the research aim, including these factors may cause the model less intuitive for designers to use. But 
                    future studies could compare or connect this paper to other research that utilizes climate-based metrics as explanatory factors of LST.<br><br>

                    3. At the same time, as the goal of our study is not to develop a faultless GAN model that can perform better than other state-of-the-art models but
                     to showcase the application of GAN in predicting LST and link the application to the field of architectural and urban design practices, we did not 
                     include any other models for comparison.<br><br>

                    4. Moreover, the research did not include any comprehensive model-tuning process, cross-validation, or random initialization to refine the model to 
                    perfection. However, based on the work showcasing the power of generative AI in informing designers done by this paper, future research needs to 
                    pay attention to improving the accuracy of relevant models through comprehensive evaluation and optimization.<br><br>

                    5. In addition, due to the limitation of data availability, the study did not highlight the longitudinal or even real-time features of LST datasets. 
                    We have tried our best to gather high-quality LST data with little cloud cover that can be utilized to serve our research aim but could only acquire 
                    five maps at discrete time stamps to represent summer months. <br><br>

                    6. For future studies around LST and built environment, apart from continuing to explore the scope provided by this paper, training machine learning 
                    algorithms in multi-dimensions may help draw conclusions on how urban morphology relates to LST. However, despite the drawbacks above, the general
                     methodology has potential universality since this study essentially focuses on fitting GAN models to connect human-constructed environmental features 
                     with naturally observed data on a fine scale.
